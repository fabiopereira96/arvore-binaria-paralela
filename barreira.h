/*
 * barrier.h
 *
 * This header file describes the "barrier" synchronization
 * construct. The type barrier_t describes the full state of the
 * barrier including the POSIX 1003.1c synchronization objects
 * necessary.
 *
 * A barrier causes threads to wait until a set of threads has
 * all "reached" the barrier. The number of threads required is
 * set when the barrier is initialized, and cannot be changed
 * except by reinitializing.
